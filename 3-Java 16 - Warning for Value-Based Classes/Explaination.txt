Some classes, such as java.util.Optional and java.time.LocalDateTime, are value-based. 
Such Instances of a value-based class are final and immutable. Such classes have annotation @jdk.internal.ValueBased 
and Java 16 now generates compile time warnings in case such classes are synchronized using synchronized keyword. 
Wrapper classes are value based. For example, Double class is a value based.

Example
package java.lang;
@jdk.internal.ValueBased
public final class Double extends Number
   implements Comparable<Double>, Constable, ConstantDesc {
   //...
}
