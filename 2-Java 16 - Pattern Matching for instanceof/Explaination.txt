Java 14 introduces instanceof operator to have type test pattern as is a preview feature. 

Type test pattern has a predicate to specify a type with a single binding variable.

It continues to be a preview feature in Java 15 as well. With Java 16, this feature is now a part of standard delivery.

Syntax
if (person instanceof Employee e) {
   return e.getEmployeeId();
}
